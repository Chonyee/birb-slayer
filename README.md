Birb Slayer is a simple 2D Unity clicker game where the objective is to not let the birds past the left side of the screen.

This project was created for my final project for CMP_SCI 3140 at UMSL. I plan on adding more features to the game.

## How to Play

The game can be played on the browser through <a href="https://simmer.io/@chonyee/birb" target="_blank">here</a> or downloaded [here]
